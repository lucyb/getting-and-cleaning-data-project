Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================

This project is part of the Coursera [Getting and Cleaning Data course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning).

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This project contains the following files:

* README.md
  This document, providing background information on the project and describing the other files in the project.

* CodeBook.md
  The code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

* run_analysis.R
  This script downloads the datasets and processes them to create a single, tidy dataset. 

* getting-and-cleaning-data-project.Rproj
  The R project information.

The background information about the data used in this project:

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the [data was obtained](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Running the `run_analysis.R` script will retrieve this data and produce a single, tidy dataset, which can be used in later analysis. This is written as a text file into a `data` directory within the current project directory.
